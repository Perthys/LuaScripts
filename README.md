# LuaScripts
This is where I put the scripts that I make. You know, when I first started I was lost... I didn't know how to properly preform simple tasks such as walking or creating a simple index op code tuple jmp namecall hook variadic eq vanilla luau / luac lbi bytecode sql injection transpiler xss vulnerability converter. I was bed ridden my entire life. When I started to learn lua, everything changed. I became a happier person and my ability to walk was coming back. This changed my life, and I hope it will change yours too. This is why I open source all of my work, so newcomers of lua will be able to experience the same feelings that helped me get out of my hardships in life. I thank the people through my lua journey who have helped me from day in to day out, from when I first became paralyzed in my legs, to where I am now. Without them, I would never have been able to achieve the things I have accomplished today. Thank you for reading. &lt;3
